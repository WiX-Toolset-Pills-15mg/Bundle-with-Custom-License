# Bundle with Custom License

## Description

This pill will demonstrate how to include MSI packages into a bundle.

### a) Tutorial (article)

-  TBD

### b) Code example

- [sources](sources)
- I provided the complete Visual Studio solution that solves the described problem. Use it if you need to test it by yourself, in your environment or if you have further ideas that you want to verify.

### c) Code notes

- A shorter version of the tutorial can be found directly in the source code.
  - Open Visual Studio solution
  - Search (Ctrl+Shift+F) for the `START` comment. It usually can be found in the `Product.wxs` file, but it is not a rule.
  - Then follow the `Step` comments in the numbered order.
- **Note:** The `NEXT` tags at the end of each comment indicates the file where to search for the next `Step`.
